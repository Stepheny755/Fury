Team members installed camera libraries for CMUcam5 pixy, our robotâ€™s planned camera. 
Then, team members checked the compatibility of the camera with colour sensing. 
Next, the team worked on developing an outline of the camera mount, while ensuring compatibility with the main robot. 
Following this, the team implemented new source files to header files and made progress on rail design to hold modular components within the robot.

Today the team learned about square waves. 
We propposed a model where the the Jetson was connect to the motor controller via cat 5 ethernet cable. 
Connected to the Motor controller we would of course have 8 motors.
We also set up an ethernet connection between the Jetson and the old Raspberry Pi.

Progress was slow today because we had not yet paid the $600 to register for robosub.
We discussed adding a "stinger", to our design, in order to reduce heat.
The "stinger" would be a aluminium rod, with high SA, allowing for quick heat release.
We also attempted to learn about soldiering, and taking apart an AC Adapter.

Today we did work with the depth sensor.
We also asked for a 3 D accelerometer for our PID controller.
We also did, and I quote "stuff and numbers on the screen" ~ steph, the team leader

We plan to reuse the python library for our motor instead of remaking the libraries in C++. 
We are also able to utilize the Vex controller as a substitute controller for testing purposes while we wait for the PID Controllers. 
The box containing the Pi will be on the outside of the chasis.
